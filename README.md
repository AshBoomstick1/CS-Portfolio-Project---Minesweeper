# CS-Portfolio-Project---Minesweeper
This is my Minesweeper game for my Codecademy Corse CS: 101

Objective: Uncover all clear tiles

The number on each clear tile is the number of mines in any of the 8 surroduning tiles
A flag is represented by an X
If you have removing flags turned off, placing a flag on a clear tile ends the game

If you don't have python you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Then you can run the code in the IDE
